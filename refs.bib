The model captures aspects such as sign or size asymmetry and heteroskedasticity, which are commonly observed in financial markets. The focus is on parameter estimation, inference and volatility forecasting in a Bayesian framework. An MCMC sampling scheme is employed for estimation and shown to work well in simulation experiments. Finally, competing range-based and return-based heteroskedastic models are compared via out-of-sample forecast performance.

abstract = {The literature on range volatility modeling has been rapidly expanding due to its importance and applications. This chapter provides alternative price range estimators and discusses their empirical properties and limitations. Besides, we review some relevant financial applications for range volatility, such as value-atrisk estimation, hedge, spillover effect, portfolio management, and microstructure issues. In this chapter, we survey the significant development of range-based volatility models, beginning with the simple random walk model up to the conditional autoregressive range (CARR) model. For the extension to range-based multivariate volatilities, some approaches developed recently are adopted, such as the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model, the double smooth transition conditional correlation (DSTCC) GARCH model, and the copula method. At last, we introduce different approaches to build bias-adjusted realized range to obtain a more efficient estimator.},

abstract = {There is a large collection of literature on energy price forecasting, but most studies typically use monthly average or close-to-close daily price data. In practice, the daily price range constructed from the daily high and low also contains useful information on price volatility and is used frequently in technical analysis. The interaction between the daily high and low and the associated daily range has been examined in several recent studies on stock price and exchange rate forecasts. The present paper adopts a similar approach to analyze the behaviour of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price over a ten-year period. We find that daily highs and lows of the WTI oil price are cointegrated, with the error correction term being closely approximated by the daily price range. Two forecasting models, one based on a vector error correction mechanism and the other based on a transfer function framework with the range taken as a driver variable, are presented for forecasting the daily highs and lows. The results show that both of these models offer significant advantages over the na{\"{i}}ve random walk and univariate ARIMA models in terms of out-of-sample forecast accuracy. A trading strategy that makes use of the daily high and low forecasts is further developed. It is found that this strategy generally yields very reasonable trading returns over an evaluation period of about two years. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The model can capture sign or size asymmetry and heteroskedasticity, such as that which is commonly observed in financial markets. A mixture proposal distribution is developed in order to improve the acceptance rate and the mixing issues which are common in random walk Metropolis-Hastings methods. Further, the logistic transition function is employed and its main properties are considered and discussed in the context of the proposed model, which motivates a suitable, weakly informative prior which ensures a proper posterior distribution and identification of the estimators. The methods are illustrated using simulated data, and an empirical study also provides evidence in favour of the proposed model when forecasting the volatility in two financial stock markets. In addition, the deviance information criterion is employed to compare the proposed models with their limiting classes, the nonlinear threshold CARR models and the symmetric CARR model. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.},

Findings show that the intraday realized range based estimator performed best as compared to the daily range based and classical estimator in terms of both efficiency and bias. Results of volatility estimation and forecasting performance show that realized range based estimators seems to be more economical and efficient to estimate the 'true' volatility.},

The empirical results show that the embedded Markov-switching adjustment in the range-based DCC model can clearly delineate uncertain exogenous shocks and make the estimated correlation process more in line with reality. Overall, in-sample and out-of sample tests indicate that the range-based MS-DCC model outperforms other static and dynamic hedging models. Keywords},

This method assumes that the price process on each day follows a lognormal diffusion with constant volatility for that day. It is well known that the consequent normality of the innovation distribution of the GARCH model for the return process is too light tailed to be realistic in many cases in practice. Accumulating evidence points to the NIG based approach being more realistic. This paper extends Lildholdt's model to incorporate the latter approach. An example illustrates the effectiveness of the extension.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the forecasting performance of extreme-value volatility estimators for the equity-based Nifty Index using two-scale realized volatility. This benchmark mitigates the effect of microstructure noise in the realized volatility. Extreme-value estimates with relatively simple forecasting methods provide substantially better short-term and long-term forecasts, compared to historical volatility. The higher efficiency of extreme-value estimators is primarily responsible for this improvement. The extent of possible improvement in forecasts is likely to be economically significant for applications like options pricing. By including extreme-value estimators, the forecasting performance of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) can also be improved. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The covariance between stock and bond returns plays important roles in the setting up of asset allocation strategies and portfolio diversification. In the present study, we propose a multivariate range-based volatility model incorporating dynamic copulas into a range-based volatility model to describe the volatility and dependence structures of stock and bond returns. We then go on to assess the economic value of the covariance forecasts based on our proposed model under a mean-variance framework. The out-of-sample forecasting performance reveals that investors would be willing to pay between 39 and 2081 basis points per year to switch from a dynamic trading strategy under the return-based volatility model to a dynamic trading strategy under the range-based volatility model, with more risk-averse investors being willing to pay even higher switching fees. Furthermore, additional economic gains of between 33 and 1471 annualized basis points are achieved when taking the leverage effect into consideration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, it has the smallest variance among all estimators with similar properties.
